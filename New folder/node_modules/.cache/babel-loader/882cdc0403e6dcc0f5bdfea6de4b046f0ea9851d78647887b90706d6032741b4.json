The OHE is supported by swiveling type Cantilever bracket assembly. A tension of 1000 kgs is given in each conductor i.e., Catenary and Contact wire. This tension is kept constant, automatically compensating the variations in conductor length due to change in temperature through the regulating equipment erected at the termination of conductors, also known as Automatic Tensioning Device. The Catenary wire comprises 19 strands of cadmium copper, each strand of 2.10 mm dia, with overall dia of 10.5 mm having about 80% conductivity and 65 sq. mm cross-sectional area. The contact wire is a solid hard drawn grooved electrolytic. copper of 12.24 mm dia and 107 sq. mm cross-sectional area. The total current carrying capacity of both wires is 600 Amps. The condemning size of contact wire is 8.25 mm. The OHE span varies between 72 Meters and 27 Meters with a step of 4.5 M. The maximum span of 72 M is adopted on the section having wind pressure of 112.5 kgs/ M2 and 75 kgs/M2 only. The span is reduced on curvature depending upon the degree of curvature. As a standard practice, an independent mast is used to support the OHE for each track to obtain mechanical independence Steel masts are of Four types BFB (Broad Over Head Equipments Flanged Beam) RSJ (Rolled Steel Joist) the fabricated rectangular sectional mast of K and B type. Portals are also used to serve multiple track section where space between two tracks to locate an independent mast is not adequate. There are three types of Portals in use i.e., N, O & R type. P, G, and double BFB type uprights are used where track separation is less. All Masts & Portals are galvanized before installation.Traction Mast / Portals are embedded in the concrete foundation. There are the different type of foundations which are used according to soil pressure and location. The five standard types of foundations mostly used are : Side Bearing Side gravity New Pure gravity Wet Black cotton soil Dry Black Cotton Soil A presage of 100 mm is provided on the contact wire for the maximum span of 72 meters and proportionately reduced for lesser spans. Regulated OHE with 100 mm presage is considered suitable for 160 Kmph speed operation. The contact wire is staggered at support so that as the pantograph glides along the contact wire, the contact wire sweeps to and fro across the bearing surface of the pantograph span up to a distance of 200 mm on either side of the centre line of pan on tangent track and 300 mm on curved tracks towards the outer side. This ensures uniform wear of the steel strips of the pantograph. The electrical clearance between live part, and earthed part i.e. fixed structures or moving load shall be maintained normally as large as possible. The minimum clearance under worst condition of temperature, winds etc are given below: Minimum Vertical distance for: Long duration \\u2013 250 mm Short duration \\u2013 200 mm Minimum horizontal distance for: Long duration \\u2013 250 mm Short duration \\u2013 200 mm The OHE conductors are terminated at intervals of 1.5 kilometers and suitably anchored. The changeover is made by overlapping the conductors, normally on 3 spans. The conductor\\u2019s height at support is so adjusted that the conductors are physically clear from any obstruction under all conditions as well as the pantograph glides over from one conductor to another smoothly without any spark. There are two types of overlap: Uninsulated Overlap: In this type of overlap, the distance between two conductors is kept 200 mm and the conductors are permanently connected by jumpers to have electrical continuity. Insulated Overlap In this case, the two OHE conductors are kept apart at a distance of 500 mm. The electrical continuity at the insulated overlap is bridged by Interrupters or Isolating Switches except at Neutral Section (SP).In regulated OHE, to ensure uniform distribution of the mechanical tension in the OHE conductors, an anti-creep point is installed at the midpoint of the tension length of OHE conductor. Section Insulators are provided to insulate the OHE of one track and another track, such as at turnouts & crossover, and to separate secondary tracks and sidings from the main line or other sidings.When the pantograph of a locomotive passes from one track to another along a crossover, current collection changes from one OHE to another. The runners do have the overlap so that there may not be any sparking during the changeover.Solid core Porcelain Insulators are used to support the OHE as Bracket and Stay arm Insulators. For termination, 9 ton insulators are used.

The capacity of each traction transformer is sufficient to feed its own feed zone and half of the adjoining feed zone. Feeding Post (FP): To feed 25 KV traction power to OHE. The section of OHE normally fed by a traction transformer. Feed Length: The distance for which a traction transformer will feed power in emergent conditions i.e., the distance between two adjoining FPs. Over Head equipment (OHE): A system of conductors / equipment carrying traction power from traction substation to electric locomotive. Neutral Section (NS): To separate OHE of two adjoining feed posts. A short neutral section (PTFE) type is provided opposite the Traction Sub Station to avoid the need of lowering the pantograph during extended feed conditions. Sectioning Post (SP): To facilitate the extension of traction power from one feed zone to half of the adjoining feed zone during an emergency. Parallel the UP and DN OHE in double the sections. Sub-sectioning and paralleling post (SSP): To sectionalize OHE. To parallel the UP and DN OHE in double line sections. Sector: The section of the OHE between the FP & SP is called the sector. Sub-Sector: The section of the OHE between the FP & SSP, SSP & SP is called sub-sector. This is the shortest section of the OHE which can be isolated through Remote Control by the Traction Power Controller. Elementary Section (ES): This is the shortest section of the OHE which can be isolated manually for carrying out OHE maintenance work. \", /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"code\", {\n              children: \".accordion-body\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 208,\n              columnNumber: 33\n            }, this), \", though the transition does limit overflow.\"]\n          }, void 0, true, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 100,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 95,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this)]\n      }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 81,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n        className: \"accordion-item\",\n        children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h2\", {\n          className: \"accordion-header\",\n          children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"button\", {\n            className: \"accordion-button collapsed\",\n            type: \"button\",\n            \"data-bs-toggle\": \"collapse\",\n            \"data-bs-target\": \"#collapseThree\",\n            \"aria-expanded\": \"false\",\n            \"aria-controls\": \"collapseThree\",\n            style: myStyle,\n            children: \"PSI\"\n          }, void 0, false, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 215,\n            columnNumber: 13\n          }, this)\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 214,\n          columnNumber: 11\n        }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n          id: \"collapseThree\",\n          className: \"accordion-collapse collapse\",\n          \"data-bs-parent\": \"#accordionExample\",\n          children: /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"div\", {\n            className: \"accordion-body\",\n            style: myStyle,\n            children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"strong\", {\n              children: \"This is the third item's accordion body.\"\n            }, void 0, false, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 233,\n              columnNumber: 15\n            }, this), \" It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element.

A tension of 1000 kgs is given in each conductor i.e.,\r\n              Catenary and Contact wire. This tension is kept constant,\r\n              automatically compensating the variations in conductor length due\r\n              to change in temperature through the regulating equipment erected\r\n              at the termination of conductors, also known as Automatic\r\n              Tensioning Device. The Catenary wire comprises 19 strands of\r\n              cadmium copper, each strand of 2.10 mm dia, with overall dia of\r\n              10.5 mm having about 80% conductivity and 65 sq. mm\r\n              cross-sectional area. The contact wire is a solid hard drawn\r\n              grooved electrolytic. copper of 12.24 mm dia and 107 sq. mm\r\n              cross-sectional area. The total current carrying capacity of both\r\n              wires is 600 Amps. The condemning size of contact wire is 8.25 mm.\r\n              The OHE span varies between 72 Meters and 27 Meters with a step of\r\n              4.5 M. The maximum span of 72 M is adopted on the section having\r\n              wind pressure of 112.5 kgs/ M2 and 75 kgs/M2 only. The span is\r\n              reduced on curvature depending upon the degree of curvature. As a\r\n              standard practice, an independent mast is used to support the OHE\r\n              for each track to obtain mechanical independence Steel masts are\r\n              of Four types BFB (Broad Over Head Equipments Flanged Beam) RSJ\r\n              (Rolled Steel Joist) the fabricated rectangular sectional mast of\r\n              K and B type. Portals are also used to serve multiple track\r\n              section where space between two tracks to locate an independent\r\n              mast is not adequate. There are three types of Portals in use\r\n              i.e., N, O & R type. P, G, and double BFB type uprights are used\r\n              where track separation is less. All Masts & Portals are galvanized\r\n              before installation.Traction Mast / Portals are embedded in the\r\n              concrete foundation. There are the different type of foundations\r\n              which are used according to soil pressure and location. The five\r\n              standard types of foundations mostly used are : Side Bearing Side\r\n              gravity New Pure gravity Wet Black cotton soil Dry Black Cotton\r\n              Soil A presage of 100 mm is provided on the contact wire for the\r\n              maximum span of 72 meters and proportionately reduced for lesser\r\n              spans. Regulated OHE with 100 mm presage is considered suitable\r\n              for 160 Kmph speed operation. The contact wire is staggered at\r\n              support so that as the pantograph glides along the contact wire,\r\n              the contact wire sweeps to and fro across the bearing surface of\r\n              the pantograph span up to a distance of 200 mm on either side of\r\n              the centre line of pan on tangent track and 300 mm on curved\r\n              tracks towards the outer side. This ensures uniform wear of the\r\n              steel strips of the pantograph. The electrical clearance between\r\n              live part, and earthed part i.e. fixed structures or moving load\r\n              shall be maintained normally as large as possible. The minimum\r\n              clearance under worst condition of temperature, winds etc are\r\n              given below: Minimum Vertical distance for: Long duration – 250 mm\r\n              Short duration – 200 mm Minimum horizontal distance for: Long\r\n              duration – 250 mm Short duration – 200 mm The OHE conductors are\r\n              terminated at intervals of 1.5 kilometers and suitably anchored.\r\n              The changeover is made by overlapping the conductors, normally on\r\n              3 spans. The conductor’s height at support is so adjusted that the\r\n              conductors are physically clear from any obstruction under all\r\n              conditions as well as the pantograph glides over from one\r\n              conductor to another smoothly without any spark. There are two\r\n              types of overlap: Uninsulated Overlap: In this type of overlap,\r\n              the distance between two conductors is kept 200 mm and the\r\n              conductors are permanently connected by jumpers to have electrical\r\n              continuity. Insulated Overlap In this case, the two OHE conductors\r\n              are kept apart at a distance of 500 mm. The electrical continuity\r\n              at the insulated overlap is bridged by Interrupters or Isolating\r\n              Switches except at Neutral Section (SP).In regulated OHE, to\r\n              ensure uniform distribution of the mechanical tension in the OHE\r\n              conductors, an anti-creep point is installed at the midpoint of\r\n              the tension length of OHE conductor. Section Insulators are\r\n              provided to insulate the OHE of one track and another track, such\r\n              as at turnouts & crossover, and to separate secondary tracks and\r\n              sidings from the main line or other sidings.When the pantograph of\r\n              a locomotive passes from one track to another along a crossover,\r\n              current collection changes from one OHE to another. The runners do\r\n              have the overlap so that there may not be any sparking during the\r\n              changeover.Solid core Porcelain Insulators are used to support the\r\n              OHE as Bracket and Stay arm Insulators. For termination, 9 ton\r\n              insulators are used.

The capacity of each traction transformer is sufficient\r\n              to feed its own feed zone and half of the adjoining feed zone.\r\n              Feeding Post (FP): To feed 25 KV traction power to OHE. The\r\n              section of OHE normally fed by a traction transformer. Feed\r\n              Length: The distance for which a traction transformer will feed\r\n              power in emergent conditions i.e., the distance between two\r\n              adjoining FPs. Over Head equipment (OHE): A system of conductors /\r\n              equipment carrying traction power from traction substation to\r\n              electric locomotive. Neutral Section (NS): To separate OHE of two\r\n              adjoining feed posts. A short neutral section (PTFE) type is\r\n              provided opposite the Traction Sub Station to avoid the need of\r\n              lowering the pantograph during extended feed conditions.\r\n              Sectioning Post (SP): To facilitate the extension of traction\r\n              power from one feed zone to half of the adjoining feed zone during\r\n              an emergency. Parallel the UP and DN OHE in double the sections.\r\n              Sub-sectioning and paralleling post (SSP): To sectionalize OHE. To\r\n              parallel the UP and DN OHE in double line sections. Sector: The\r\n              section of the OHE between the FP & SP is called the sector.\r\n              Sub-Sector: The section of the OHE between the FP & SSP, SSP & SP\r\n              is called sub-sector. This is the shortest section of the OHE\r\n              which can be isolated through Remote Control by the Traction Power\r\n              Controller. Elementary Section (ES): This is the shortest section\r\n              of the OHE which can be isolated manually for carrying out OHE\r\n              maintenance work. <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the\r\n              transition does limit overflow.\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"accordion-item\">\r\n          <h2 className=\"accordion-header\">\r\n            <button\r\n              className=\"accordion-button collapsed\"\r\n              type=\"button\"\r\n              data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\"\r\n              data-bs-target=\"#collapseThree\"\r\n              aria-expanded=\"false\"\r\n              aria-controls=\"collapseThree\"\r\n              style={myStyle}\r\n            >\r\n              PSI\r\n            </button>\r\n          </h2>\r\n          <div\r\n            id=\"collapseThree\"\r\n            className=\"accordion-collapse collapse\"\r\n            data-bs-parent=\"#accordionExample\"\r\n          >\r\n            <div className=\"accordion-body\" style={myStyle}>\r\n              <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is\r\n              hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate\r\n              classes that we use to style each element.

It's also worth noting that just\r\n              about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>,\r\n              though the transition does limit overflow.\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,IAAIC,QAAQ,QAAQ,OAAO;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAExC,eAAe,SAASC,KAAKA,CAAA,EAAG;EAAAC,EAAA;EAC9B,MAAM,CAACC,SAAS,EAAEC,UAAU,CAAC,GAAGN,QAAQ,CAAC,kBAAkB,CAAC;EAE5D,MAAM,CAACO,OAAO,EAAEC,UAAU,CAAC,GAAGR,QAAQ,CAAC;IACrCS,KAAK,EAAE,OAAO;IACdC,eAAe,EAAE,OAAO;IACxBC,MAAM,EAAE;EACV,CAAC,CAAC;EAEF,MAAMC,WAAW,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;IACxB,IAAIL,OAAO,CAACE,KAAK,KAAK,OAAO,EAAE;MAC7BD,UAAU,CAAC;QACTC,KAAK,EAAE,OAAO;QACdC,eAAe,EAAE,OAAO;QACxBC,MAAM,EAAE;MACV,CAAC,CAAC;MACFL,UAAU,CAAC,kBAAkB,CAAC;IAChC,CAAC,MAAM;MACLE,UAAU,CAAC;QACTC,KAAK,EAAE,OAAO;QACdC,eAAe,EAAE;MACnB,CAAC,CAAC;MACFJ,UAAU,CAAC,mBAAmB,CAAC;IACjC;EACF,CAAC;EAED,oBACEJ,OAAA;IAAKW,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;IAACC,KAAK,EAAEP,OAAQ;IAAAQ,QAAA,gBACxCb,OAAA;MAAKW,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;MAAAE,QAAA,eACnBb,OAAA;QAAKc,KAAK,EAAC,wBAAwB;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACjCb,OAAA;UACEc,KAAK,EAAC,kBAAkB;UACxBC,IAAI,EAAC,UAAU;UACfC,EAAE,EAAC,wBAAwB;UAC3BC,QAAQ,EAAEP;QAAY;UAAAQ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACvB,CAAC,eACFrB,OAAA;UAAOc,KAAK,EAAC,kBAAkB;UAACQ,GAAG,EAAC,wBAAwB;UAAAT,QAAA,EACzDV;QAAS;UAAAe,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACL,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACL;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH,CAAC,eAENrB,OAAA;MAAIW,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;MAACC,KAAK,EAAEP,OAAQ;MAAAQ,QAAA,EAAC;IAErC;MAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLrB,OAAA;MAAKW,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;MAACK,EAAE,EAAC,kBAAkB;MAAAH,QAAA,gBAC9Cb,OAAA;QAAKW,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;QAAAE,QAAA,gBAC7Bb,OAAA;UAAIW,SAAS,EAAC,kBAAkB;UAAAE,QAAA,eAC9Bb,OAAA;YACEW,SAAS,EAAC,kBAAkB;YAC5BI,IAAI,EAAC,QAAQ;YACb,kBAAe,UAAU;YACzB,kBAAe,cAAc;YAC7B,iBAAc,MAAM;YACpB,iBAAc,aAAa;YAC3BH,KAAK,EAAEP,OAAQ;YAAAQ,QAAA,EAChB;UAED;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACP,CAAC,eACLrB,OAAA;UACEgB,EAAE,EAAC,aAAa;UAChBL,SAAS,EAAC,kCAAkC;UAC5C,kBAAe,mBAAmB;UAAAE,QAAA,eAElCb,OAAA;YAAKW,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;YAACC,KAAK,EAAEP,OAAQ;YAAAQ,QAAA,gBAC7Cb,OAAA;cAAAa,QAAA,EAAQ;YAAsB;cAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAQ,CAAC,uYAMM,EAAC,GAAG,eACjDrB,OAAA;cAAAa,QAAA,EAAM;YAAe;cAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAM,CAAC,gDAE9B;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAK;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNrB,OAAA;QAAKW,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;QAACC,KAAK,EAAEP,OAAQ;QAAAQ,QAAA,gBAC7Cb,OAAA;UAAIW,SAAS,EAAC,kBAAkB;UAAAE,QAAA,eAC9Bb,OAAA;YACEW,SAAS,EAAC,4BAA4B;YACtCI,IAAI,EAAC,QAAQ;YACb,kBAAe,UAAU;YACzB,kBAAe,cAAc;YAC7B,iBAAc,OAAO;YACrB,iBAAc,aAAa;YAC3BH,KAAK,EAAEP,OAAQ;YAAAQ,QAAA,EAChB;UAED;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACP,CAAC,eACLrB,OAAA;UACEgB,EAAE,EAAC,aAAa;UAChBL,SAAS,EAAC,6BAA6B;UACvC,kBAAe,mBAAmB;UAAAE,QAAA,eAElCb,OAAA;YAAKW,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;YAACC,KAAK,EAAEP,OAAQ;YAAAQ,QAAA,gBAC7Cb,OAAA;cAAAa,QAAA,EAAQ;YAAmB;cAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAQ,CAAC,yvNA2GlB,eAAArB,OAAA;cAAAa,QAAA,EAAM;YAAe;cAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAM,CAAC,gDAEhD;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAK;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNrB,OAAA;QAAKW,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;QAAAE,QAAA,gBAC7Bb,OAAA;UAAIW,SAAS,EAAC,kBAAkB;UAAAE,QAAA,eAC9Bb,OAAA;YACEW,SAAS,EAAC,4BAA4B;YACtCI,IAAI,EAAC,QAAQ;YACb,kBAAe,UAAU;YACzB,kBAAe,gBAAgB;YAC/B,iBAAc,OAAO;YACrB,iBAAc,eAAe;YAC7BH,KAAK,EAAEP,OAAQ;YAAAQ,QAAA,EAChB;UAED;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAQ;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACP,CAAC,eACLrB,OAAA;UACEgB,EAAE,EAAC,eAAe;UAClBL,SAAS,EAAC,6BAA6B;UACvC,kBAAe,mBAAmB;UAAAE,QAAA,eAElCb,OAAA;YAAKW,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;YAACC,KAAK,EAAEP,OAAQ;YAAAQ,QAAA,gBAC7Cb,OAAA;cAAAa,QAAA,EAAQ;YAAwC;cAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAQ,CAAC,+WAMxB,eAAArB,OAAA;cAAAa,QAAA,EAAM;YAAe;cAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAM,CAAC,gDAE/D;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAK;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACH,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACH,CAAC;AAEV;AAACnB,EAAA,CApPuBD,KAAK;AAAAsB,EAAA,GAALtB,KAAK;AAAA,IAAAsB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
